              Marie was excellent, very prompt, clear and friendly. Would
              recommend for first home buyers who want to be kept in the loop
              and shown all the steps.

              We were fortunate enough to have Carley from Settle Easy help us
              with our first home purchase. We feel incredibly lucky that we had
              her to explain the different parts of the process and answer the
              many questions we had. We said to one another multiple times
              &apos;Thank god for Carley, she&apos;s incredible.&apos; It meant
              a lot that she was so forward with getting details, and advocating
              for us with the sellers and always keeping us up to date with what
              was happening. We cant thank her enough for everything she did for
              us.

              We are first time property buyers and were buying a block of land
              - Carley from Settle Easy was absolutely amazing from start to
              finish. She went above and beyond at every single stage of the
              process, keeping us in the loop the entire time, explaining what
              she was doing and why, making sure we understood what was
              happening. Buying a property is stressful enough, you don&apos;t
              need the extra worry of a Conveyancer that needs constant chasing.
              Incredible service!
